    <h2 class="mt-4">Getting Started</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Create or Identify Your Valve:</strong>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Upload Spec Sheets:</strong>
            <p>Spec sheets can be uploaded via the <a href="/upload-spec-sheet">Upload Spec Sheet</a> page. This helps associate critical documentation with your valves.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accepted formats: PDF, DOCX, XLSX</li>
                <li>Optional: Link the spec sheet to a specific valve by providing its ID.</li>

            <strong>Upload Test Plans:</strong>
            <p>Navigate to the <a href="/upload-test-plan">Upload Test Plan</a> page to upload your test plans. These plans will be parsed and stored for execution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accepted formats: PDF, CSV, TXT</li>
                <li>Each test plan should include steps like "Open Valve 50%".</li>

            <p>After running a test plan, you can view the results on the <a href="/view-results">View Results</a> page. Logs and statuses for each step will be displayed.</p>
